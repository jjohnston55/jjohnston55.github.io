                        My name is Jeff Johnston and I am a Full Stack Developer based in Edmonton, Alberta.
                        I am passionate about learning new technologies and strive to continue expanding my skillset.
                        When I am not developing, I spend my time playing video games, snowboarding, and camping.

                        I acquire new tasks easily and have maintained Dean’s List (Honour’s) Standing at NAIT. I received positive performance reviews from past employers, and I believe I can further contribute to your team. 
                        I am hard-working and dependable and I understand the importance of confidentiality and professionalism in the workplace. I am able to work independently or as an enthusiastic and contributing member to a team. 
                        My previous work terms taught me valuable employee interaction skills and I developed the ability to effectively communicate with fellow staff. 
                        I possess strong problem solving skills, in both the academic and work environment and do what it takes to get the job done, even under trying circumstances.
